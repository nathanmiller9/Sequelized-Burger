## Code Explanation

Though this is a small application, there was a large amount of code required to make it work because this is an exercise that is laying the foundation for what larger scale applications will require.  The MVC design pattern was used in order to configure the project into an organized and manageable structure by separating the model, controllers, config files, and static assets.  This was a great exercise to practice partitioning and connecting code and an excellent introduction to constructing larger scale applications.
